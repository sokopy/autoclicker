# AUTOCLICKER
This program is a simple autoclicker which will do nothing but spam the click button (I guess). You just have to execute the program, enter the amount of times you want the program to click and wait 5 seconds. Now, here is a detailed tutorial on how to properly use it, step by step, from cold and dark.

## How to use it
### - Go to the [executable file](https://github.com/sokopy/autoclicker/blob/master/autoclicker.exe) and click "download"
